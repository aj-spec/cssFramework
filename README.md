### All algorithms implemented in CSS only!
All implementations are to compleme or extend my css framework with new or cool/awesome features.
If you want to contribute an awesome feature feel free to open an issue and commit your solution or work on an existing issue you are assigned to.


## Inspiration & Motivation

Over the last years I worked with different kind of CSS Frameworks - most times with all different Versions of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
And I stared to add some fancy stuff to the basic stuff of Bootstrap... every project again. 
So I now want as my Hacktoberfest 2021 Project build my own css Framework with all the stuff I always add to the Vanilla Bootstrap and even more - let you join if you have awesome ideas for CSS Features.

You can start using the current Bootstrap Version 5.1 and extend it with new classes/styles or features.
I Issues you can find some of my ideas I want to implement. Feel free to comment if you like me to assign you to one of these. I will accept more than one solution per issue, because finally I will select the best for the final version of the framework. :)

## Contributing Guidelines

### Open Issues
When you open a new issue, please make sure to write a shord description what you want to implement with your css-code.
eg. "Implement a frosted glass effect for backgrounds"
If you create/open a new issue you are automatically assigned to it!
If you want to contribute to an issue just comment below and I will assign you to it. 

 
### Folders and Files
Please make sure your files are in an Folder with the issue Number you are assigned to and your Name eg: '003_vJechsmayr' or '005_kopfrechner'.
So I can find your solution for a given Issue. If you are assigned to more than one issue make sure to create a new folder for each issue.


### Pull Requests
Only Pull Requests **joined with an Issue** (Issue Number in the message or manually joined) and matching the **naming-conventions** (See Folders and Files) will be merged!
